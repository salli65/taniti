        <h1>Welcome to the island of Taniti!</h1>
        <p>
            Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied
            and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that
            includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the
            Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.
